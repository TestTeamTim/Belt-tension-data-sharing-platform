## Introduction:

This repository serves as a timing belt tension data sharing platform for all 3D printing enthusiasts. Since there are too many different models and types of 3D printers for us to test them all. We decided to create this platform for everyone to share their test results, and to make it easier for everyone to find the most suitable timing belt tension for their printers.

## How to find exsisting results:

You can use your printer model number to search in the [tension_summary](./summary) file

## How to perform the test:

- Get the [tension_data_template](./templates)

- Follow the Guide [here](https://prorifi3d.com/pages/how-to-tune-your-timing-belt)

## How to submit your test results:

- Test result should be submitted via the form of "Pull request"

- To do this, fork the repo first

- Then create a new folder in the data folder, named with your [nickname]+[date]

- Fill the tension data template, rename it with your printer model and put the file in the folder you just created.

- Start a "Pull request"
